📘 AR-Enhanced Interactive App for Computer Hardware  

📌 Overview  
This project is an **Augmented Reality (AR)-powered interactive app** designed to help users explore **3D models of computer hardware components** such as **CPU, motherboard, RAM, SMPS, storage devices, and ports**. The app enhances learning by providing immersive AR experiences, allowing users to visualize and interact with computer hardware in real time.  

 ✨ Features  
- 🔹 **AR-Powered Learning** – View and interact with 3D models in augmented reality  
- 🔹 **Detailed Hardware Visualizations** – Explore the internal structure of key components  
- 🔹 **Easy Access** – Works on AR-supported devices with a simple scan  
- 🔹 **Open-Source & Scalable** – Developed using GitHub for collaboration  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Blender** – 3D model creation  
- **WebAR (AR.js, 8thWall, or similar)** – Augmented Reality integration  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project management  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### 🔧 Prerequisites  
- A device with AR support (mobile/tablet with a compatible web browser)
